Here are **three detailed examples** for each of the **12 common issues** in PCB firmware development:

---

### 1. **Hardware-Software Integration Issues**
   - **Example 1:** Firmware assumes a GPIO pin is configured as an output, but the hardware schematic shows it as an input, causing the pin to malfunction.  
   - **Example 2:** A UART peripheral is initialized at the wrong baud rate, leading to garbled communication with an external device.  
   - **Example 3:** Firmware attempts to use a hardware timer that is not enabled in the clock configuration, resulting in no timer interrupts.

---

### 2. **Memory Corruption**
   - **Example 1:** A buffer overflow occurs in a firmware function, corrupting adjacent memory locations and causing erratic behavior.  
   - **Example 2:** Improper handling of EEPROM writes leads to data corruption during power loss.  
   - **Example 3:** Firmware fails to initialize the stack properly, causing a stack overflow and system crash.

---

### 3. **Timing and Synchronization Bugs**
   - **Example 1:** Two tasks in a real-time operating system (RTOS) access a shared resource without proper mutex protection, causing data corruption.  
   - **Example 2:** A delay function in firmware is not precise, causing missed deadlines in a time-sensitive application.  
   - **Example 3:** An interrupt service routine (ISR) takes too long to execute, blocking other critical tasks.

---

### 4. **Peripheral Configuration Errors**
   - **Example 1:** ADC is configured with the wrong reference voltage, leading to incorrect analog readings.  
   - **Example 2:** PWM duty cycle is set incorrectly, causing a motor to run at the wrong speed.  
   - **Example 3:** DMA is configured to transfer data to the wrong memory address, corrupting critical data.

---

### 5. **Debugging Challenges**
   - **Example 1:** A system goes unresponsive during development, but there are no logs or debug outputs to trace the issue.  
   - **Example 2:** Firmware crashes intermittently, making it difficult to reproduce and debug the problem.  
   - **Example 3:** Debugging tools are not available for a custom PCB, forcing developers to rely on trial and error.

---

### 6. **Firmware Update Failures**
   - **Example 1:** Firmware update process is interrupted due to a power failure, leaving the device in an unrecoverable state.  
   - **Example 2:** New firmware version is incompatible with older hardware revisions, causing the device to malfunction.  
   - **Example 3:** Firmware update mechanism does not verify the integrity of the downloaded file, leading to corrupted firmware.

---

### 7. **Power Management Bugs**
   - **Example 1:** Firmware fails to wake up from sleep mode due to incorrect configuration of wake-up sources.  
   - **Example 2:** Device consumes excessive power in idle mode because peripherals are not properly disabled.  
   - **Example 3:** Power supply noise causes the microcontroller to reset intermittently.

---

### 8. **Communication Protocol Errors**
   - **Example 1:** Firmware does not handle I2C bus contention properly, causing communication to fail when multiple devices are connected.  
   - **Example 2:** SPI clock polarity is configured incorrectly, leading to data misalignment.  
   - **Example 3:** UART communication fails because the firmware does not handle parity errors.

---

### 9. **Hardware-Related Bugs**
   - **Example 1:** PCB traces are too close, causing crosstalk and signal integrity issues.  
   - **Example 2:** A capacitor on the power supply line is undersized, leading to voltage drops during peak loads.  
   - **Example 3:** A faulty component on the PCB causes intermittent failures that are difficult to diagnose.

---

### 10. **Firmware Logic Errors**
   - **Example 1:** A state machine gets stuck in an undefined state due to missing transitions.  
   - **Example 2:** Firmware does not handle edge cases, such as invalid input data, causing crashes.  
   - **Example 3:** A loop in the firmware runs indefinitely due to an incorrect exit condition.

---

### 11. **Asserts and Error Handling**
   - **Example 1:** Firmware does not use asserts to validate function parameters, leading to undefined behavior.  
   - **Example 2:** Error handling is missing for critical operations, such as writing to flash memory.  
   - **Example 3:** Asserts are enabled in production firmware, causing the system to halt instead of recovering gracefully.

---

### 12. **Compatibility Issues**
   - **Example 1:** Firmware works on one microcontroller but fails on another due to differences in peripheral implementations.  
   - **Example 2:** A third-party library is incompatible with the compiler version being used, causing build errors.  
   - **Example 3:** Firmware assumes a specific hardware feature is available, but it is missing in a newer hardware revision.
