question:
```
In the ACP part after the PHX, if the DMIC is connected to the Codec, we need to remove it in the BIOS ASL.
```

answer:
```
DMIC disable: Do't include AcpChildPDM.asl, the microphone will not appear in the OS.
```

Expanded:
```
When configuring the ACP (Audio Co-Processor) section following the PHX platform implementation, if the DMIC (Digital Microphone) is directly connected to the Codec hardware, the following BIOS ASL (ACPI Source Language) adjustment is required:

Technical Implementation:

ACPI Configuration Modification:

Remove any references to the AcpChildPDM.asl file from the ACPI table configuration. This file typically contains the ACPI device declaration for the DMIC hardware path.

System-Level Effects:

This exclusion triggers the following changes:

The DMIC device node will be omitted from the ACPI namespace during BIOS initialization
The operating system's device enumeration process will not detect the physical DMIC hardware
Audio input routing will be fully managed through the Codec's defined interfaces
Technical Rationale:

This configuration prevents dual-path audio input conflicts between the ACP and Codec subsystems. By removing the DMIC declaration from ACPI:

Ensures exclusive signal path control through the Codec
Eliminates resource allocation overlaps (IRQ/IO/Memory)
Maintains compliance with ACPI 6.4 specifications for device hierarchy management
Avoids potential driver conflicts in OS-level audio subsystem management
The modification preserves system stability while maintaining full microphone functionality through the Codec-defined audio path.
