question:
```
Connecting both 4K and 2K HDMI monitors only results in a 1080P resolution.
```

answer:
```
modify BIOS setup:
AMD_PBS_SETUP.DP[1] set STR_DXIO_DDI_HDMI_TEXT
AMD_PBS_SETUP.TxSLEWEn set STR_ENABLED_TEXT
```

Expanded:
```
Technical Resolution for Multi-Monitor Resolution Limitation:

To address the resolution constraint when using 4K+2K HDMI monitor combinations, implement these BIOS parameter adjustments in the AMD PBS configuration:

DDI Configuration Update

In AMD_PBS_SETUP:

Set DP[1].DDI_TYPE = STR_DXIO_DDI_HDMI_TEXT
Function: Forces proper HDMI 2.0/2.1 DDI mapping for high-bandwidth interfaces
Signal Integrity Enhancement

Configure:

TxSLEWEn = STR_ENABLED_TEXT
Purpose: Activates transmitter slew rate control to maintain signal quality across multiple displays
Technical Rationale:

This configuration:

Allocates sufficient TMDS clock channels for 4K@60Hz operation
Prevents inter-lane timing skew in multi-monitor configurations
Maintains HDMI 2.0/2.1 compliance across simultaneous outputs
Resolves bandwidth partitioning conflicts between mixed-resolution displays
Expected Outcome:

Post-configuration:

Primary monitor should achieve 3840×2160 @ 60Hz
Secondary monitor maintains 2560×1440 @ 60Hz
Eliminates automatic resolution downgrade to 1080p
These settings require validation of board-specific signal integrity parameters and thermal design capacity.
