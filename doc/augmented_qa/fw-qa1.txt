question:
         Low battery power is less than 4%. Connect to PD power supply >Do not turn on (displays low battery icon) light
answer:
         TYPE C PD AC Loss:Can be confirmed with an oscilloscope
variation-1
question:
        What diagnostic method is recommended when a device shows the low battery icon but won't power on despite being connected to a PD charger?
answer:
        Use an oscilloscope to verify TYPE-C PD power delivery status and check for AC loss abnormalities in the charging circuit.

variation-2:
question:
          How should technicians confirm PD charger functionality when encountering a persistent low battery warning?
answer:
          Technicians can employ oscilloscope measurements to analyze the PD power supply waveform and detect potential AC signal interruptions in the TYPE-C interface.
